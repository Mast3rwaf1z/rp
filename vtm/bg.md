## Background

He is addicted to crack and has difficulties sustaining his addiction outside of bigger cities in his home country so he's moved to Hamburg 3-5 years ago to find work where he's managed to learn German. He chose to go to hamburg based on his old, retired dealer's connections and during these years he's gotten to know numerous people in that environment, both sellers and users.

He has been a part of the countryside criminal society in poland and the criminal underground of Hamburg for many years such that he has a fairly significant role, but not a leader of anything specific.

### Relation to Lars
He met Lars in one of the nights in the city where they became friends and Aleksy offers him some of his drugs from time to time when they meet each other.
