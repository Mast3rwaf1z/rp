## Background

He is addicted to crack and has difficulties sustaining his addiction outside of bigger cities in his home country so he's moved to Hamburg 3-5 years ago to find work where he's managed to learn German. He chose to go to hamburg based on his old, retired dealer's connections and during these years he's gotten to know numerous people in that environment, both sellers and users.

He has been a part of the countryside criminal society in poland and the criminal underground of Hamburg for many years such that he has a fairly significant role, but not a leader of anything specific.

### Relation to Lars
He met Lars in one of the nights in the city where they became friends and Aleksy offers him some of his drugs from time to time when they meet each other.

### Doggo
had an interest in learning english in school and subsecquently english and american culture, and thought calling his dog something like fireball or in the end lightning sounded cool
nowadays Aleksy just calls his dog Schatz (treasure in german)

### Allies
One of them is a friend Aleksy made when he first came to Hamburg, his name is Bruno, not exactly in the drug trade business in Hamburg but he does have ties to various gangs around Hamburg.

His childhood friend whom he traveled with to Hamburg, he currently is studying to be a teacher in germany, but he is still a person who meets up with Aleksy from time to time. he is of course, open to the use of drugs. His name is Alfred. 

### Drug organisations n stuff

Aleksy doesn't work for one particular organisation, he just knows he has a boss that handles all his trades where he is free to quit his job as a drug mule anytime as he volunteered to work for them. The organisation however operate out of one particular bar with an entrance in an alleyway in Hamburg. One of those alleyways you gotta know where it is to get there.
