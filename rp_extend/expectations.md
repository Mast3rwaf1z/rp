#	Expectations for future campaigns
*	Ingen computere ved bordet
*	Jeg vil gerne have en verden der er godt forklaret, let at følge, ikke for forvirrende første par sessions
*	som sif har sagt så er noget sandbox agtigt meget spændende
*	krelles skole stuff?
*	Jeg vil gerne have at DM'en har meget af verdenen beskrevet, ikke nødvendigvis til os men bare så de er sikker på hvad der skal ske
## more stuff
*   hvad forventer du selv at lave til backstory til os


# art
my two characters crime organisation logo: (a little thing related to backstory) which is completely undescided design wise so you can choose whatever you like, my DM mentioned that it could be something like some faces melted together as the leaders of it is a family of changelings

my old character: Tim, surrendered to his madness basicly, he's half ranger half bard with a lot of different personalities and appearances but to the party appeared to be a ginger human man with a large beard and short hair, he primarily used a bow and a little flute often hung on the bow, as he surrendered to his madness he got a cross shaped birthmark filling the entirety of his face.

my new character, a changeling Wizard in the school of Necromancy, he's the brother of Tim but despises him for his stupidity, he wears a black robe branded with his family's organisation's logo and is usually followed by a horde of undead. he is also a changeling but is usually in the appearance of a Dark Elf man

### state of impel
right arm, is glowing in necrotic damage, make it purple glow, green glow, light blue glow, whatever looks the most painful

can't move due to strength being set to 3, and is probably leaning against either the table or the next person

is wearing black robes with the above example of a logo, doesn't need to be visible

is wizard so he is usually seen with a black tome n shit with all sorts of necromancy
