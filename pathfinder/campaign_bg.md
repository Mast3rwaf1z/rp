   *  This city is located right up against the sea so its natural for the wizardry to lead to them also venturing out to sea
   *  Key character in this area?
      *  My (mentors? teachers?):
         *  A very charismatic wizard and a strict fighter
*  Pirate Crew?
   *  Full crew of wizards and magi
   *  Taught in the arts of magi by a crewmate
   *  all are vampires(and dhampir)
   *  some are recruited by being turned into vampires or they were already.
   *  short story with the crew
	  *  The crew has not always been all vampires, they were once a "normal" pirate crew, until an unfortunate event happened
	  Before the crew was turned into vampires it was a normal crew originating from the city of wizardry.
	  
	  The crew comes across a city ruled by a council of vampires after hearing about it a few months earlier, they continue to attempt to raid the city as pirates do.
	  
	  While the enhabitants of this city pose little threat to the average pirate crew they split up and try to raid as many homes as possible.
	  
	  During the raid of these homes, each member of the pirate crew are being kidnapped (by followers of the council) and taken to a prison cell within the city.
	  
	  Once the entire crew is gathered within the prison cell a mysterious figure, a member of the council appears to tell them that they have two options to go from here:
	  
	  For each member of the crew they can either be hanged in this city for robbing innocent homes, 
	  
	  or they could become vampires and serve under the council in this city as pirates of this city.
	  
	  In the end most of the crew chose to be hanged within the city where some escaped to join the crew as mortals while the rest chose to become vampires serving the council.
	  
	  Among the men who chose to stay and serve the council were two notable men:
	  *   My captain
	  *   My teacher in the arts of Magi
	  
	  The crew takes on some new crew at the city ruled by the vampire council, among these people are \<insert character name here> which is a young dhampir looking for training
	  
	  The crew spends a few months to return to the city of wizardry where they choose to let the young dhampir stay and study wizardry.
	  
	  A few years pass and the pirate crew eventually returns to the city of wizardry, \<insert character name here> feels ready to join the crew, where they join and set sail with them.
	  
	  During their travels \<insert character name here> was taught to use the magic they've learned to fight in hand to hand combat, thus making \<insert character name here> a magus.
